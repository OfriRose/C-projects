# C Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of small C projects, each organized in its own folder. These projects demonstrate various data structures, algorithms, and utilities implemented in C. Each project is self-contained and includes source code, headers, and tests where applicable.

## Projects Overview
- **calculator**: A simple calculator library and test suite.
- **data structures**: Implementations of common data structures such as bit arrays, binary search trees, circular buffers, dynamic vectors, doubly linked lists, finite state machines, hash tables, heaps, priority queues, and schedulers.
- **sorts**: Sorting algorithms and related tests.
- **uid**: Unique ID generator utility.

Each project folder contains its own README with more details.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a project folder for specific instructions and details.
- Build and run tests using the provided makefiles or binaries.
