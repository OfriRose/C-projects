# Data Structures

This folder contains implementations of various data structures in C. Each subfolder is a separate project with its own source code, headers, and tests.

## Included Data Structures
- **bit_array**: Efficient bit manipulation utilities.
- **bst**: Binary Search Tree implementation.
- **cbuff**: Circular buffer (ring buffer).
- **cmp_sort**: Comparison-based sorting algorithms.
- **d_vector**: Dynamic array/vector.
- **dlist**: Doubly linked list.
- **fsm**: Finite State Machine.
- **hash_table**: Hash table implementation.
- **heap**: Heap data structure.
- **pqueue**: Priority queue and supporting structures.

## Usage
Each subfolder contains its own README and test files. Explore them for details and usage instructions.
