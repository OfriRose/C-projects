## Structure
- `src/`: Source code for sorting algorithms.
- `include/`: Header files.
- `test/`: Test cases for sorting functions.
- `bin/`: Compiled binaries.

## Usage
Build and run the tests to see the sorting algorithms in action.

---
Useful for understanding and experimenting with different sorting techniques in C.
